% Given r Principal Components (PCs) and N sets of r coefficients, the function builds 
% N new shapes as linear combinations of the PCs, and then adjusts result according to bedrock.
% Only r=size(coeff,2) PCs are used in the linear combination.
%
% INPUTS
% PC:    (Nlat)x(Nlon)x n matrix with n Principal Components
% M:     (Nlat)x(Nlon) matrix of means, to be added to linear combination
% coeff: Nxr matrix of coefficients. In each row, the r coefficients
%        corresponding to the PCs for that input are specified.
%
% OUTPUT
% Z: (Nlat)x(Nlon)x N, with j-th new shape in Z(:,:,j).


function Z = build_shapes(PC, M, coeff)

Nlat=size(PC,1);
Nlon=size(PC,2);
p=Nlat*Nlon;

N = size(coeff,1);
r = size(coeff,2);

% Give a warning if needed
if r>size(PC,3)
    error('The coefficients are provided for a number of PCs greater than the PCs available');
end

% Retain only needed components ...
PC=PC(:, :, 1:r);
% ... and reshape all quantities as vectors to allow multiplications
PC=reshape(PC, [p,r]);
M=reshape(M, [p,1]);

% Generate shapes as linear combination ...
Z = M*ones(1,N) +  PC*(coeff'); % p x N
Z = reshape(Z, [Nlat, Nlon,N]);

% ... and then adjust bedrock

Bed=ncread(str, 'Bedrock');
%Bed=remask(Bed, nan, 0);  % puts nan outside physical_mask, and 0s in cells being inside the
